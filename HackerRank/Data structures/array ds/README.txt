ARRAY DATA STRUCTURES.

THis algorithum basically works on return function.The numbers are been inputed in array by users and been stored in a list having space separated.
once the array is been stored in a list we have to reverse the number presented in a list supose our input is[1,2,3,4] our output should be [4,3,2,1].

This is done by defining a reversearray.
This algorithum logic consists that first we need to define a function in which our list is stored using 'def' func. And once we defined then we have to use 'return' function
which basically returns our output in our desired form
'returna[::-1]' here means that first ':' is used to start the numbers in a list and second':' is used to reach its end and '-1' is used to print output from last.
